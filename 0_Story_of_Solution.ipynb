    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for this project was sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and consists of **891** records with **12** features including `['PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp','Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', 'Embarked']`. The target variable is binary indicating survival (1) or not (0).\n",

    "#### Source of Data\n",
